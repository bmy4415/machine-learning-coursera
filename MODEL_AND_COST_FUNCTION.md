- Supervised Learning: we are `given right answer` at train time
- regression: we predict `real-valued output`
- classification: we predict `discrete-valued output`
- MSE(Mean Squared Error): frequently used cost function at regression problem
    - 1/2 in MSE is just scaler
- hypothesis: our predictor function
- cost function: what we want to `minimize`
