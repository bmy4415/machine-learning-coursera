- matrix: 2d array
- vector: matrix with only 1 column(1d array)
- cf) tensor: nd array
- dimension of matrix: (# of row X # of col)
- matrix is not `commutative` but `associative`
- square matrix: # of rows and # of columns are same
- Identity matrix
    - square matrix such that diagonal values are 1 and others are 0
    - for all matrix A, AI = IA = A
- Transpose matrix
    - change all rows with all columns
- singular matrix: matrix that does not have inverse matrix
- when using matrix operation in programming, it can be optimized via parallel processing
