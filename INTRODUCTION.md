#### Supervised Learning
- we are given data set and its correct answer
    - regression: predict real value
    - classification: predict discrete(categorical) value

#### Unsupervised Learning
- There is no exlicit answers on given data set
    - therefore no feedback based on data
    - Clustring: grouping given data set into several groups
